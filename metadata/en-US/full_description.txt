<b>StreamRadio (Sweded)</b>

This app plays network radio channels on Android.

ğŸ‘‰ category icon
ğŸ‘‰ Add your custom channels to list
ğŸ‘‰ A day (and night) mode is added (Day: 6:00-17:59)

Some predefined channels are already selectable. The predefined List: <tt>app/src/main/res/raw/channel_list.properties</tt>

It is a fork of < a href="https://github.com/Starcommander/StreamRadio">StreamRadio</a> but with a bit newer style. I call it <i>geschwedet</i>.
