This app plays internet radio streams. The app is a fork of the WebRadio app - but with a changed editor, a focus on rock music and a comic music visualization. The design of the app has been renewed and some new features and corrections have been added (night mode, power saving, Notification Channel since android 8). By modifying the code a backwards compatibility back to Android 4.1 was reached.

Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/leela52452">Leela</a> for a telugu translation. This language is spoken by 81 million people in South India.

Without a worldwide cooperation via Github and FOSS (free open source software), that ALL would not be possible!
